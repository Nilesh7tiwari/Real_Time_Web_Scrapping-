# Real_Time_Web_Scrapping-
In this project i did real time web scrapping on cars.com, using requests, pandas and BeautifulSoup libraries. 
I am adding my jupyter notebook which help you to understand project more clearly. I performed this project on two half where in the first half i scrapped data from a single page and in the second half i did scrapping for multiple pages. I am uploading a dataset on my Kaggle account you can download it from https://www.kaggle.com/nileshtiwari7/1000-used-car-price-data. data set includes name, price, milage reviews, review_count and badges , this data set is collection of used car so you can choose it to build a machine learning model about prediction of prices and various other project. This data set consist of total 1000 rows which is perfect for beginners to start with Machine Learning models.
